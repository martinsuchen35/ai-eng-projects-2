00:11:39	Roberto Gtz:	Every Token is restricted to only words ? 

Can they be like ‘phrasal verbs’ or small phrases that are always find together ?
00:18:18	Deepanjan Majumdar:	Dont we need the tokeniser to be the order the corpus words are in @Ali Aminian ?
00:18:53	Chetan Nadgouda:	raise hand in zoom to ask questions..
00:18:57	Chang Liu:	Are there any best practices on how we assign IDs to the vocabulary?
00:27:39	Anoop Chandramohanan Nair:	decode ids not text right?
00:27:42	Mohamad Elarabi:	decode(ids)
00:28:11	Soumya:	Handling new words is not scope of this exercise ??
00:31:10	Chang Liu:	How are LLMs handling typos
00:32:19	Mohamad Elarabi:	word2id.get(tok, word2id["UNK"])
00:33:56	Elena:	Instead of introducing “UNK”, can we update the vocab and add the new tokens into it?
00:35:09	Soumya:	encode_list = [word2id.setdefault(x, len(word2id)) for x in text_list] --> We can always add to our vocab
00:37:11	Simon in Brisbane:	Word Level Tokenizer Questions
Can the tokenizer order swapped out? I could see a case where training order is optimized differently from the inferencing. eg. Using some memory data object for training, then a different for speed when inferencing?
00:37:13	Lam W:	Why lower the str?
00:38:03	jricardo_rr:	Replying to "Instead of introdu..."

Yeah, I had the same question as well. Why can't it be dynamic and be updated as new words appear?
00:39:18	Maruthi ChandraSekhar:	Replying to "Instead of introduci..."

Iiuc its because training is done with words already in the known set
00:39:58	Ganesh Kandisa:	Replying to "Instead of introduci..."

In that case people can fill garbage words(such as ‘hadibahfiu’, ‘assdhfasjfa’) and explode vocabulary 🙂

00:40:15	Elena:	Reacted to "In that case people ..." with 👍
00:40:16	Mohamad Elarabi:	Replying to "Instead of introduci..."

the tokenizer is just a dictionary. Without training new words are useless
00:40:25	Elena:	Replying to "Instead of introduci..."

Got it, thanks! 🙂
00:41:57	Rahul Khadse:	Replying to "Are there any best p..."

Hey Chang, Not sure. TBH it depends on vocab and company and also Language.. But there are some reserved tokens if that helps. Like UNK -> PAD, CLS - SEP, MASK, BOS, EOSAlso, GPT2 onward I think in order to incorporate different languages - they started byte level encoding as well. Hope this helps
00:43:39	Chetan Nadgouda:	What about punctuations? To keep the context of the framing of sentence?
00:43:58	Chetan Nadgouda:	e.g. ? ! and so on

00:46:04	Shuanak Khedkar:	In general are spelling mistakes handled In tokenizer ? Or that is on the prompt cleaning?
00:46:41	Mohamad Elarabi:	I think that's in prompt cleaning
00:53:43	Deepanjan Majumdar:	When u say relation what does that mean @Ali Aminian  ?
00:54:18	Deepanjan Majumdar:	Is it for the attention phase ?

00:59:35	Chang Liu:	Does the recent Deepseek OCR paper change how we think about the role of tokenizers in the future?
01:01:33	Rahul Khadse:	If anyone here has ever taken the GRE… you’ll know the pain. Out of those 50,000 words, we basically had to recite 10,000 of them. 😂 (totally exaggerating… but it felt like it!)

01:02:26	Rahul Khadse:	Replying to "Instead of introduci..."

You can add reduce the count of UNK nown words ; but you always need / should have UNK in vocab
01:02:46	Mohan:	How hugging face has access to these LLM Model Tokenizers?
01:03:00	venu.samprathi@yahoo.com:	Reacted to "Does the recent Deep..." with 👍
01:03:46	Mohamad Elarabi:	Replying to "How hugging face has..."

they're made public by their authors
01:04:48	Rahul Khadse:	Replying to "How hugging face has..."

^^^ Many LLM developers (OpenAI, Google, Meta, Anthropic, etc.) publish their tokenizer definitions alongside the model weights, often in open repositories.
01:04:48	Deepanjan Majumdar:	Emojis are also part of vocab @Ali Aminian  thats amazing
01:05:06	Rahul Khadse:	Replying to "How hugging face has..."

01:23:50	Somindra:	torch.randn, right?
01:24:17	Somindra:	randn to keep the random weights between 0 and 1?
01:25:34	Chang Liu:	Is nn.Linear initialized with random values?
01:28:02	Maruthi ChandraSekhar:	What’s the difference between all the packages 
AutoModelForCausalLM, GPT2LMHeadModel, etc 
Is there some layout?
01:28:15	Chetan Nadgouda:	lost you there for 30 seconds
01:28:18	Colm Nee:	Replying to "randn to keep the ra..."

I think either is fine, rand returns uniformly distributed numbers between 0 and 1, and randn returns normally distributed numbers. In practice, I believe randn is used more for this purpose as it will output fewer numbers closer to 0 and 1, which can slow down convergence.
