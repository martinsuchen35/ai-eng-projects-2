00:16:07	Wahid:	Replying to "Question: What happe..."

Hmm, I'm not sure either, something to experiment for sure; but thinking out loud: it would probably depend on what kind of prompt engineering the user is establishing

For example, if we prompt engineered the llm to be a "customer support chatbot", and the user also prompts with "act like a customer support chatbot" — this may be redundant but I don't think the output would be "worse", something to try though 🤔
00:18:48	Dereck Duran:	What if I need to add documents or update the documents? Do I need to make new pipeline to watch fro changes?
00:22:45	Ashwin Sam George:	Replying to "What if I need to ad..."

Yea had the same question what if more context was inserted
00:27:08	Wahid:	Replying to "What if I need to ad..."

After the source data is updated, I don't think you need to update anything on the actual RAG chain side of things. Because the retrieval happens at query time (as in this example), so as long the db is updated prior to the query, it should just get the updated information to augment the generation

So the data ingestion layer needs to be updated (i.e. update the vector store), but nothing needed for the RAG chain part
00:28:10	Aaron LeBlanc:	Replying to "Question: What happe..."

Im thinking more about if the user stacked COT or other methods with our pre-developed COT or other methods system prompts
00:29:13	Achinto Banerjee:	In production systems , do we typically use langchain for loading pdf or we directly use the lib . For ex: the PyMuPDF can be used directly .

00:36:32	Khadija Sitabkhan:	Do we need to chunk only the ‘page_content’ or the entire raw_document?
00:37:51	Ashwin Sam George:	Is choosing a embedding model crucial 
if so how do we choose an embedding model
00:38:53	Amar Bat:	Did we replace the raw_docs with the output from the WebBaseLoader?
00:39:08	Dereck Duran:	Reacted to "Did we replace the r..." with 👍
00:42:18	Safikur Khan:	Is the bigger model for sentence transformer means it gives more accurate search result? I meant how can we determine which one to pick for a customer support RAG?
00:42:52	Ashwin Sam George:	So im guessing based of the embedding model we can handle large chunked data and all based of the what its context window
00:50:28	Safikur Khan:	I guess this vectordb.saveaslocal() is storing locally. How can we store in the remote server like pgvector etc?
00:51:17	Prasad A:	Reacted to "I guess this vectord..." with 👆
00:51:42	Prasad A:	How do we decide which model is good for a given job?
00:51:58	sachinjo:	Can chunks be extracted  based on context and avoid fixed length chunks before embedding.  is there any benefits in changing chunking Size/ logic or it does not matter due to embedding
01:08:04	Sushma Shaikh:	Reacted to "How do we decide whi..." with 👍
01:12:57	Khadija Sitabkhan:	Are the Chunks updated from the Web URLS?
01:13:22	Manoj Pendyala:	Yeah, I think the same problem
01:13:28	Maruthi ChandraSekhar:	Where’s the context supplied to the chain?
01:18:25	Rajesh:	Is the user query made as part of the search gets converted to embedding as well before passing to the retriever?
01:20:19	Rajesh:	how can we optimize the search considering the embedding creation at runtime for userquery before injecting the output as part of the context to the LLM?
01:21:05	Khadija Sitabkhan:	Reacted to "Yeah, I think the sa..." with 👍
01:21:16	Dereck Duran:	When we pull docs from a webpage, how do we clean the text or make it suitable for the LLM to answer questions?

I used two websites for my raw docs but the \n tags is making the retrieval trash
01:23:38	sachinjo:	How do you evaluate efficacy of   chunking, embedding , retrieval  and summarization across variation ?  How do you automate efficacy evaluation the answers matches ground truth  ?
01:25:44	Dereck Duran:	Where are the solutions?
01:25:47	Rajesh:	What are the best practices to implement RAG at scale in production, specifically reducing the inference time latency ?
01:27:08	Rajesh:	Does changing the embedding model need rerun for the embedding creation or the generated vectors can work with any other model in future if we want to switch?

01:31:30	Deepanjan Majumdar:	Yes the context and other one are already standard for the lib
01:31:38	Deepanjan Majumdar:	It should be passed as is

03:10:25	Romit Dasgupta:	I think the interesting point is how do you fit a 1T+ parameter model in GPUs that no single GPU can hold with current technology (even with quantization). It probably demands splitting the layers across multiple GPUs
